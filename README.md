# Unity
Learning the Unity engine through https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer.

## Ambition
I've recently finished the junior programming track which demanded months of my life and has set me up to understand the unity framework.
On my learning journey I've created a lot of mini-games which each have distinct problems and features.
All games uploaded here are part of those pathways.
